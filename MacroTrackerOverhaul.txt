User Interface Enhancements:
Material Calendar View: Integrate a Material Calendar View at the top of the activity for date selection. This will allow users to select a date for entering meals and view meal history for specific dates.

Dynamic Data Entry Form:

Instead of static input fields for meal details, consider adding a button that opens a dialog or a bottom sheet for entering meal details. This makes the main interface cleaner.
The form can dynamically add fields for different types of macros (fats, carbs, proteins, etc.) as needed.
Meal Log Cards:

Use Material Cards to display meal logs. Each card can show essential details like meal name, date, and macro breakdown.
Include icons or images to visually represent the type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).
Enhanced Navigation:

Implement a tab layout or a segmented control for easy navigation between 'Add Meal' and 'View Meal History'.
Functional Improvements:
Date-wise Filtering:

When a date is selected from the calendar, the RecyclerView should update to show only the meals logged for that specific date.
Meal Editing and Deletion:

Allow long-press on a meal card to edit or delete the entry.
Data Validation:

Ensure that the data entered in the meal log form is valid and complete before saving.
User Feedback:

Provide visual feedback when a meal is added, edited, or deleted successfully.
Empty State:

Display a friendly message when there are no meal logs for the selected date.
Code Enhancements:
ViewModel & LiveData:

Use a ViewModel to handle data operations. LiveData can be used to observe changes in meal logs and update the UI accordingly.
Database Operations:

Perform database operations asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI thread.
Fragmentation:

Consider breaking down the activity into fragments (e.g., one for adding meals and another for viewing meal history) for better separation of concerns.
XML Layout Changes:
Calendar and Tab Layout:

Place the Material Calendar View and the tab/segmented control at the top of the activity layout.
RecyclerView:

Update the RecyclerView to use the new card layout for meal logs.
Add Meal Dialog/Bottom Sheet:

Design a separate layout for the meal entry form, which can be used in a dialog or bottom sheet.
Implementation Steps:
Date Selection Handling:

Implement a listener for the calendar view to fetch and display meals for the selected date.
Meal Entry Form:

Create a new dialog or bottom sheet fragment for meal entry.
RecyclerView Adapter:

Modify the adapter to use the new card layout.
ViewModel Integration:

Create a ViewModel for handling meal data.
Database Access:

Update the MealDAO to support fetching meals by date.
User Interaction:

Add click listeners for editing and deleting meals, and for adding new meals.
