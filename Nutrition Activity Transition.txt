Steps for Transition:
Database Setup:

Choose a reliable database system (e.g., SQLite for local or PostgreSQL/MySQL for server-based).
Design the schema considering future additions like categories, tags, etc.
Data Migration:

Gradually accumulate nutritional data from reliable sources.
Ensure data accuracy and integrity during migration.
Search Implementation:

Implement a search algorithm optimized for your data structure.
Add filters, sorting options, and pagination.
Enhance Features:

Integrate graphical representations using libraries like MPAndroidChart or AnyChart.
Add a section for tips, random facts, etc., related to nutrition.
User Experience:

Implement a clean and intuitive UI.
Add features like recent searches, suggestions, and auto-complete to enhance user experience.
Testing:

Before releasing, thoroughly test the new system to ensure data accuracy and application stability.
Collect feedback from a beta group if possible.
Release & Monitor:

Once you're confident, roll out the new system.
Monitor server loads (if applicable) and be prepared for any scalability challenges.
Iterate:

Continue to gather user feedback and make improvements over time.
